        <h2>C. LeBeau Cousineau</h2>
        <h2>The Next Steven Spielberg</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Christian LeBeau Cousineau. I am almost done with a BS in Communication
        with a Video Production emphasis and a Business Management Minor. The ultimate goal would be
        be either a director or a producer for the Church.</p>
        <p>I like to play video games, watch TV, movies, and YouTube. I love the filmmaking process
        and I enjoy writing, both for film or novels. I love to laugh and make other people laugh.</p>
        <p>What I love most about BYU-Idaho is the oportunity it provides to become more than I thought
        I could be. The atmosphere here really lends itself to becoming the best versions of ourselves.
        That is the Spirit of Rick's afterall.</p>
        <p>I was always kind of curious about coding, at least since I got to school, and I want to learn
        how to host my website on my own computer so I would only have to worry about paying for the domain
        and not pay a dime for server space. Also, as a small business owner, I think it is a good idea to
        know web development so you can build your website and truly make it your own without the limitations
        of the plug-n-play platforms like Squarespace or Wix.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 20 years, now. I served
        a mission in Riverside, California from 2016-2018. One of my favorite quotes from a Church Leader is
        from Elder Bruce R. McConkey:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"I am one of his witnesses, and in a coming day I shall feel the nail 
                marks in his hands and in his feet and shall wet his feet with my tears.</p>

                <p>But I shall not know any better then than I know now that he is God's Almighty Son, that he is our Savior
                and Redeemer, and that salvation comes in and through his atoning blood and in no other way."</p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>My favorite scripture is Psalm 23:1-6:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>

                <p>2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
                
                <p>3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</p>
                
                <p>4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with
                me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p>
                
                <p>5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my
                cup runneth over.</p>
                
                <p>6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of
                the Lord for ever."</p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>The last thing I will share is that my favorite movie is Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life.</p>
